The things I want from myself, for myself and from the world

- I want to have good physical and mental health
- I want to have people I care about and people who care about me and a GIANT overlap between the two :D 
- I want to have a lot of time to spend with these people
- I want to find out what I can really do
- I want a world where I have faith in the system and feel like contributing to it
- I want an endless stream of puzzles and games and games within games within games ....
- I want to keep acquiring skills forever and forever and forever
- I want a world where we NEVER solve EVERYTHING or find THE TRUTH or even if we do we can erase our memories and start over again (a puzzle you don't manage to solve ... but you get closer ever so slightly is the best puzzle)
- I want us to be wiser, more competent, and more interesting, and design a world where we wake up each day to try and solve THIS puzzle (aka life). I don't want to waste time learning 5D chess-like rules just to file taxes so that these people who aren't even qualified to run the world in ways that reflect the will of the people can hold me accountable for my tax calculations.
- I want a world where we can (its legal and possible) rent out entire planets and have death matches (consensual .. duh)
which are streamed live across the universe
- I want all the magic back!!
